                            <p>Eldy is from the Greater New Orleans area and been raised in a very rich hispanic environment which is why he struggles with writing, so forgive any grammar mistakes. Eldy joined the Concrete Canoe Team his freshman year simply because the idea of a concrete canoe sounded amazing. He has a lot of experience with many tools the team uses due to his construction background. He also enjoys the company of the rest of the team since the atmosphere is so relaxed and easygoing. Also he love to go to Honduras during mango season. By the way this paragraph cause Eldy get suffering as he tried to proofread it. He apologizes again. </p>

                            <p> Connie is a junior studying Chemical and Material Science Engineering. Connie has always enjoyed water and canoeing in the great outdoors. When she heard about the team freshman year, she totally wanted to join, but somehow got lost in the sea of college. So she joined sophomore year. Connie really likes how the team not only gets her away from all her CHE friends, but also how close and friendly the rest of the team is. They're like a family, especially after her parent moved away from her hometown of Troy, MI to someplace warm in Cali. Outside of canoe, Connie's also involved in Habitat for Humanity. In her free time, she sings, dances, sleeps, and generally acts awkward and awesome at the same time. </p>

Adding Concrete Canoe is basically infinity fun. She joined the team her sophomore year because it sounded super awesome and the team’s smaller size gives it a really comfortable atmosphere. Outside of canoe, Lauren works as a peer advisor in the Engineering Advising Center and the Engineering Career Resource Center, as well as working in a research lab. She also enjoys listening to music and trying to find obscure bands so she can be pretentious about listening to them. </p>

                            <p>Ryan Meredith is originally from Troy, Michigan and is currently a sophomore in Electrical Engineering. He was first introduced to the team by his brother in Fall 2013 and decided to stay for the fun people and change of pace from his other activities. As head of paddling practice this year, Ryan hopes to teach the team strategies to do the two most important things in canoe racing: going straight and turning (preferably at a fairly fast speed). In his free time, Ryan enjoys playing video games, watching YouTube videos, and listening to music. </p>

                            <p>An honorary engineer by pressure (peer pressure), Zach helped MCCT revamp and refresh their identity in the summer of 2009. A marketer-in-training, Zach helped to raise funds in sponsorships with some local businesses. Although he is gone in body, he is not gone in spirit or artistic freelance work. Zach still helps the team by providing graphic designs for the team's theme, paper, or whatever they e-mail him six weeks out from competition. His humor may be missed, but maybe it isn't because the laughter he provided sometimes halted important canoe production. Anyways, he wishes the team well every year and will always be willing to help out.</p>

Outside of the team Nate is the program chair of the NAME Quarterdeck Society, and a peer mentor the Naval Architecture Engineering 100 section.

                            <p>Zack is a team member that "doesn't fit". A New Jersey native, Zack is one of the few east coast members on the MCC team, but one of the many from the region that attend U of M. Moreover, he isn't the typical concrete canoe teammate. He is (maybe now the only??) Biomedical Engineer on the team, and interestingly enough, has more of an interest in medicine than engineering. Zack joined as a freshman, and this year will be his fourth year on the team. On a snowy day in March 2011, Zack attended UM for an Engineering Campus Day; during a tour of the Wilson Center, he first saw the concrete canoe team at work. When he realized concrete really can float, he knew he would love to join the team. He plans to continue his role of canoe-design and construction. Last year, he earned the title "Mixmaster" for mixing the cement that made up the canoe on pour day (of course with help). Zack loves music, especially electronic dance music, and sports, and is even an athlete on the University of Michigan Men's Varsity and Club Lacrosse teams. Ultimately, he hopes to bring home some trophies for the Michigan Concrete Canoe team before his time is done. </p>

                            <p>First year with concrete canoe (2014-2015). Enjoys the small team aspect of the group, being able to be part of every aspect. Aspiring aerospace engineer with graduation expected in 2018. From all over, but MI is definitely one of the best places other than maybe Italy or Portugal where he lived for a while. Enjoys listening to music, reading, cooking, and traveling. Especially traveling. </p>
